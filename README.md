# PostalSystem
 Postal Office system made in java. Front end done in java fx and database developed with MySql

Note:
  The backend is done and implemented keeping in light the entire postal office system we had in mind. But for this specific project we were supposed to implement a few use cases so the functional ones are mostly track parcel, login and sign up. Manage inventory and customer service are dummy functionalities. 

The main structure of the code is as follows
1) the backend has 2 packages, One for post office and one for front end.
2) The Post Office package has all the classes and also has a MySQL handler which connects to the Database.
3) The SQL file is also added
4) Then we have another package which has front end controllers and the javaFX files.
